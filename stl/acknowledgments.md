All parts are from [E3D hemera Mount and cooler for Cr-10 and Ender 3 by Tragical](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4061250) except mentioned otherwise

- `BLTouchMount.stl`: I designed from scratch (and my measurements) but after trying the one from the pack above so there is some inspiration from there.
- `HemeraMount.stl` is from the pack, I only increased the size of the holes for the hex nut for the BLTouch mount.
- `PartFan.stl` is unmodified. Print it with the arms up.
- `PartFanArm.stl` is unmodified. Print it with the hex nut slots facing up.
